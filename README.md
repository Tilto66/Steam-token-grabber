### How do I put it in .exe format  
Install python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 You have 2 options. Either you:
1. You run in a cmd <code>pip install pyinstaller</code>    
2. <code>cd C:/your/path/where/is/your/folder </code>   
3. <code>pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=icone.ico graber.py</code>    
Or else run the Compile.bat

### What are the parameters of the last command ?
<code>--onefile</code> to output only one .exe executable.
<code>--noconsole</code> so that there are no console upon running.
<code>--icon</code> if you want an icon.
<code>graber.py</code> the file you want to compile
you can type <code>pyinstaller --help</code> to display all the options. 

### Does it work on a machine that doesn't have Python ?
Yes it does ! 

### Can i change the code ?
Sure ! Feel free to edit but if you publish the code, follow the GNU AGPL V3 and credit me 😉
